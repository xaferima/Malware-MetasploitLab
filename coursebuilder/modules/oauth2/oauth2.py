"""Oauth2 module implementation.

In order to use this module with your app you must enable it in main.py by
changing

    modules.oauth2.oauth2.register_module()

to

    modules.oauth2.oauth2.register_module().enable()

Additionally, you must:

1. Visit https://code.google.com/apis/console. Click on API Access and create a
   client id for your web app with redirect URI set to:

   https://<appid>.appspot|googleplex.com/<callback_uri>

   and optionally include

   http://localhost:<port>/<callback_uri>

   where <appid> is your app id, <callback_uri> is the oauth2 callback URI you'd
   like to use, and <port> is the port you'd like to use for localhost. You can
   set <port> and <callback_uri> to basically whatever you want as long as they
   are unique.

2. Once you've created the client id, click Download JSON. Take the file you get
   and overwrite client_secrets.json in this directory.

3. In https://code.google.com/apis/console, click on Services and enable the
   services your app requires. For these demos, you'll need to enable Drive API
   and Google+.

Whenever you change scopes you'll need to revoke your access tokens. You can do
this at https://accounts.google.com/b/0/IssuedAuthSubTokens.

You can find a list of the available APIs at
http://api-python-client-doc.appspot.com/.

Finally, a note about dependencies. Oauth2 requires google-api-python-client,
which you can find at https://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client/. We
bundle version 1.1 with Course Builder. It requires httplib2, which you can find
at https://code.google.com/p/httplib2/. We bundle version 0.8 with Course
Builder.

It also requires python-gflags from https://code.google.com/p/python-gflags/. We
bundle 2.0 with Course Builder, and we've repackaged the downloadable .tar.gz as
a .zip so Python can load its contents directly from sys.path.

Good luck!
