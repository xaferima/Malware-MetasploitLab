  # Main page blurb. (The '|' at the beginning enables multi-line input.)
  blurb: |
    A theoretical focus is not enough to understand malicious software. 
    To stop properly malware attacks, professionals should also have a practical knowledge of this field. 
    Hence, the purpose of the lab is to provide appropriate material for students within an environment trained and safe. 
    They will learn and experiment behavior, techniques, and applications of the whole types of malware.

  # If you specify both a video and an image link, then the video will take

  # Google Tag Manager ID: Fill this in with a value obtained by signing up

  # notify the tag manager (see views/base.html).  This will load a script
  # from Tag Manager which can then emit notifications to other user activity
  # trackers.  This neatly decouples changes to the source code of your

  # granular than page loads, you will need to mark up your course
  # to send notifications to the tag manager.)
